# Photography website with Vanilla HTML CSS JS
I've made this project as an exercise of creating layouts with grid and flexbox and to practice JavaScript dom manipulation, intersection observer, and making useful ux elements such as slider, desktop and mobile navbar.

## Features:
1. Fully functional slider made with pure JS. It changes the slider every two seconds, pauses when mouse hovering, and also two button for next and previous picture
2. The Gallery Grid maitains its aspect ratio
3. Navbar that comes down only when at half of gallery section.
4. JS generated overlay for each gallery link
5. Responsive
6. When under 1024 will show only two gallery posts per row
7. When under 768 there is hamburger nav, with side nav coming from left.
